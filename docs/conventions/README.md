# Conventions

Step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks. Rules in [`rules/`](../../rules/README.md) say what is allowed; conventions say how to do the task.

Conventions link to rules and never restate them. If a convention and a rule disagree, the rule wins and the convention must be fixed.

## Conventions for writing conventions

- One task per file, named `adding-...` or `fixing-...`.
- Start with the owning rules, then a numbered checklist, then a "Done when" list.
- Each step is one action; link the rule instead of restating it.
- Keep the checklist under twelve steps; split the task if it grows.
- A change to a rule that alters a procedure must update the affected convention in the same change.
