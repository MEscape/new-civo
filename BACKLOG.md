# GitHub Issue Backlog — Civic Website Platform

## Milestone: Data Integration

### Issue: Add Data Sources management to Settings

**Labels:** `feature`, `data-integration`, `admin`

### Description

Add a dedicated **Data Sources** section to the existing Settings area.

The purpose is to allow internal administrators to connect municipal, civic, and smart-city data sources that can later be consumed by website components.

### Requirements

- Add `Settings → Data Sources`.
- Display configured data sources.
- Add a new data source.
- Edit an existing data source.
- Enable/disable a data source.
- Delete a data source.
- Display connection status.
- Display last successful connection/fetch.
- Display mapping status.
- Provide a `Test Connection` action.
- Keep credentials server-side.

### Initial supported source

Start with:

- REST / JSON API

The architecture should allow additional adapters later.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Data Sources appears in Settings.
- [ ] Administrator can create a REST/JSON source.
- [ ] Administrator can edit/delete/disable sources.
- [ ] Credentials are never exposed to the client.
- [ ] Connection status is visible.
- [ ] Existing settings functionality remains unaffected.

## Issue: Implement external Data Source adapter architecture

**Labels:** `feature`, `architecture`, `data-integration`

### Description

Create the adapter layer used to communicate with external civic and smart-city data providers.

External APIs must not be coupled directly to website components.

### Target architecture

```text
Data Source
    ↓
Adapter
    ↓
External Response
    ↓
Mapping
    ↓
Canonical Data
```

### Requirements

Introduce an abstraction similar to:

```ts
interface DataSourceAdapter {
  testConnection(...): Promise<Result<..., AppError>>;
  discover(...): Promise<Result<..., AppError>>;
  fetch(...): Promise<Result<..., AppError>>;
}
```

Implement:

```text
RestJsonAdapter
```

first.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Adapter interface exists.
- [ ] REST/JSON implementation exists.
- [ ] Adapter uses `Result<T, AppError>`.
- [ ] Expected network/API failures do not throw.
- [ ] Components do not directly call external APIs.
- [ ] Adapter implementation is independently testable.

3. Perform the request server-side.
4. Apply timeout handling.
5. Validate the response.
6. Return a structured result.

### Error states

Support meaningful errors such as:

```text
DATA_SOURCE_INVALID
DATA_SOURCE_UNREACHABLE

```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test Connection button exists.
- [ ] Request executes server-side.
- [ ] Success is clearly displayed.
- [ ] Failure explains the category of problem.
- [ ] Secrets are never returned.
- [ ] No expected operational error crashes the application.

Adapter
  ↓
Mapping
  ↓
Canonical Event[]
  ↓
MunicipalityDataProvider
  ↓
EventsGrid
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Existing provider abstraction is reused.
- [ ] External datasets can provide canonical data.

---

## Issue: Add page/site revision history

**Labels:** `feature`, `publishing`, `cms`

### Description

Allow administrators to see previous published/draft versions and restore a previous version.

- restore revision.

Do not implement collaborative editing.

---

## Issue: Add scheduled publishing

# Milestone: Future Infrastructure

## Issue: Introduce authentication boundary

Introduce real authentication while preserving the existing authorization boundary.

### Important

Do not couple authentication deeply into:

- PageRenderer,

- PageConfig,
- data adapters.

Authentication should sit at the application boundary.

---

## Issue: Implement role-based authorization

**Labels:** `security`, `authorization`, `future`

### Potential roles

```text
Platform Admin
Municipality Admin
Municipality Editor
Content Editor
```

The exact roles should be determined by actual product requirements.

Authorization should control:

- data sources,
- mappings,
- media,
- pages,
- publishing,
- settings.

---

# Product Development Rule

After the core data integration work, avoid creating another massive implementation phase unless a new subsystem is genuinely large.

Prefer focused issues:

```text
One feature
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Tests
    ↓
Code review
    ↓
Architecture audit when needed
```

This keeps the codebase understandable while allowing the platform to grow.
