 *
 * Callers authorize first; the connector does not know the actor. Every
 * call re-parses the stored config and re-applies the outbound policy
 * (`parseRestConnectionConfig`, `checkOutboundUrl`, and `isPublicAddress`
 * on the resolved IP), so configuration saved before a rule existed is
 * checked again. Credentials come from a `CredentialProvider`.
 *
 * Implementations bound every call (timeout, maximum response size) and
 * translate each failure into our own error kinds. Upstream details (HTTP
 * status, response text) are logged, never returned. A kind without a
 * connector, such as MOCK, yields `connectorUnavailable()`.
