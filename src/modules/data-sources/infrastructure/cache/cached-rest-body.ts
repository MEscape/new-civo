 *                never be written into a key; the hard expiry below bounds
 *                how long a rotated credential can keep serving old data.
 *  Audience      identical for every visitor: this path only serves data the
 *                public site displays. Never route per-user data through it.
 *  Tag           `data-source:<id>`; invalidated when the source is removed.

 *                test, discovery and preview (they must show live state),
 *                and failures.
 *
 * Lifetime (seconds): clients may reuse an entry for 60; after 120 the next
 * read refreshes it in the background; after 900 it is dropped. Municipal
 * open data tolerates a few minutes of staleness, and anything tighter
 * costs one outbound request per render.
