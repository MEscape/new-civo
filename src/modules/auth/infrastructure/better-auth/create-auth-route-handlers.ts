 * opened by a browser and land here. Validation, rate limiting and the
 * token checks run inside Better Auth; this file only delegates.
 *
 * The instance is created on the first request, not at import, so a build
 * that imports the route does not need auth configuration. While auth is
 * disabled the endpoint answers 404 instead of throwing.
