/**
 * Builds the Better Auth instance. This is the ONLY place allowed to call
 * `betterAuth(...)`, and `better-auth` may be imported only from
 * `modules/auth/infrastructure` (enforced by lint). Everything else
 * reaches authentication through the ports in `domain/ports`.
 *
 * It is a factory, not a module-level constant, so importing this file
 * has no side effects (no pool, no connection) and the pool, mailer and
 * audit log are injected instead of imported.
 *
 * `satisfies BetterAuthOptions` is the compile-time guard: unlike passing
 * the literal straight to `betterAuth<O>()`, which infers `O` and skips
 * excess-property checks, it rejects a misspelled or renamed security
 * option at any depth.
 *
 * Framework coupling, by necessity: `nextCookies()` loads `next/headers`
 * to copy Better Auth's `Set-Cookie` into Next's cookie store after a
 * sign-in from a Server Action. Two behaviors are easy to miss:
 *  - It swallows cookie-write failures, so a broken write does not throw;
 *    an integration test must assert the cookie actually lands.
 *  - It skips session REFRESH while rendering a Server Component, where
 *    cookies cannot be written. Reads work; extending the session happens
 *    on the next Server Action or Route Handler request.
