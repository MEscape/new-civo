/**
 * The mapping engine's date transforms yield `Date` objects, and source
 * strings may carry any offset. The contracts accept one exact form (UTC,
 * millisecond precision), so the fields the contract names as instants are
 * converted here, at the boundary, and the domain never does date
 * arithmetic. A date-only value means midnight UTC.
 *
 * Why this is still needed with one shared `Clock`: that clock fixes how
 * THIS system reads "now". This function deals with EXTERNAL data, whose
 * offsets and shapes the system does not control, and with the engine's
 * live (unpersisted) `Date` values. The contract owner (this module, via
 * `instantFields`) is the one that knows which fields are instants, so the
 * conversion belongs here and not in the mapping engine, which only knows
 * target paths.
