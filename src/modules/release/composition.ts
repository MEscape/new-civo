/**
 * The module's composition root: the one file that knows both the
 * application use cases and their infrastructure adapters. Presentation
 * and framework entry points reach use cases only through here, so they
 * never import infrastructure. `server-only` makes an accidental import
 * from a Client Component a build error.
 *
 * Publishing and migrating a release are one capability of one module, so
 * they share every adapter: each neighbour (website, builder, component
 * registry) is wired exactly ONCE below, through its public API and behind
 * a port. A change in a neighbour is a change to exactly one adapter.
