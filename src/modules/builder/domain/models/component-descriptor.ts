 * What the builder needs to know about a component, as PLAIN DATA. The

 * controls, groups, content kinds); those are imported as types from its
 * public API and never redeclared here. One adapter turns the platform's
 * catalog into descriptors (`ComponentDescriptorProvider`). Because
 * descriptors are serializable, the server hands them to the client and BOTH
 * sides build the same catalog with `createComponentCatalog`: one
 * implementation of the nesting and edit rules instead of a server copy and
 * a client copy.
 *
 * Display text is carried as translation KEYS, exactly as the platform
 * publishes it. The catalog is built once per process, so it cannot hold
 * locale-dependent text; the presentation resolves keys per request.
