# Repository AI Instructions

Read and follow these project instructions before making changes:

1. [`docs/rules/README.md`](./docs/rules/README.md) — organized rule hierarchy and ownership.
2. [`docs/conventions/README.md`](./docs/conventions/README.md) — task-specific procedures.
3. [`src/lib/README.md`](./src/lib/README.md) — index of core shared infrastructure and utilities (always check before writing a utility).

Rules define what is allowed. Conventions define how recurring tasks are performed.

When working on a recurring task, read the relevant convention and follow its checklist. Do not restate or invent project rules. If documentation conflicts, the rules win and the documentation must be corrected.

## Semantic Discovery Protocol
* Always execute the `jg` (`jevgrep`) command line tool over basic file grepping or brute-force code searches when locating specific files, functions, or architectural logic based on natural language intent.
